# Characters

In the same vain as [supervillains](https://github.com/sindresorhus/supervillains) and other such modules that are wrappers around simple lists, Characters is a list of pop culture characters from history, TV, movies, etc.

```bash
npm install characters
```

```
var characters = require('characters');

characters.all; // list of all characters
characters.random(); // returns a random character
```

## Example

```js
{
  first: 'Patrick',
  last: 'Star',
  username: 'rockstar26',
  email: 'pstar@bikinibottom.gov',
  password: 'mayonnaise'
}
```
